// Creatures (class 5): shared movement / AI / attack / death code (0x18050..0x19b70), the wake
// timers (0x468e0, 0x46960) and the per-type state handlers.
// Owner: creature_common.cpp (shared code) + creatures.cpp (per-type Table A handlers).
// Report: docs/analysis/port_creatures.md.
//
// State layout (confirmed from every caller's `push base`): a creature type owns the six Table A
// states base .. base + 5 with **base = type * 6**:
//
//   base + 0   type-specific "extra" state (dragon / worm / emu / type 15: creature_idle_seek_leader;
//              skeleton 54: rising from the ground; builder 72: place a castle; townie 78 / trader 84: empty)
//   base + 1   main state, the one most constructors start in (creature_ai_step, or the type's own wander)
//   base + 2   attack (creature_attack_target + a per-type attack callback)
//   base + 3   follow the flock leader (creature_follow_leader)
//   base + 4   dying (creature_die)
//   base + 5   dead (creature_dead_drop_mana)
//
// The shared functions take `base` as their second stack argument and derive the target states from
// it; the names in gen/dispatch_tables.h count the +0 state to the previous type (e.g. "dragon_s6" is
// the vulture's base + 0, "genie_s72" the builder's) - the binding is by address, so it does not matter.
//
// Thing fields as creatures use them (in addition to mc_types.h):
//   timer_a  (+0x3a) awake gate: counted down by creature_proximity_wake_timer, reloaded to 0x10 while
//            the creature is within 0x1800 (xy) of the local player; pending damage is only consumed
//            and enemies are only looked for while it is non-zero
//   timer_b  (+0x3b) delay before the next proximity test (only ever cleared by the wake timer)
//   cast_ticks (+0x30) |dy| to the local player at the last wake reload (see creature_proximity_wake_timer)
//   parent   (+0x34) flock leader (segments: the segment in front), child (+0x36) first / next segment
//   turn_rate (+0x82) is a speed for creatures: a follower moves at leader.speed_cur + leader.turn_rate,
//            townies / traders walk at it while they have no destination
//   aux      (+0x1a) per-type countdown; castle_size (+0x47) per-type flag (skeleton: 1 = summoning pose)
