// Port-only debug commands (Phase 4, round 10 task B; docs/analysis/port_console.md). Nothing here exists in
// carpet.exe.
//
// Every state-changing debug action (teleport, spawn, give mana, god, kill, claim, heal, all spells, win / lose,
// damage) travels as a command packet (CmdPacket.cmd 0x40..0x5f) in the local player's command slot ->
// player_commands_process -> g_hook_port_command (debug_cmd_apply), so it is recorded in movies, replayed by
// tests and valid in lockstep. The console (mcport/console.*), scenario files (scenario.h) and the other tools
// only *build* packets with the builders below and queue them (debug_cmd_queue); this file applies them inside
// the tick.
//
// ---- packet layout ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The packet is the original's 10 bytes; b[0] = CmdPacket.cmd, b[1] = arg, b[2] = pad2, b[3] = steer_x,
// b[4] = steer_y, b[5] = bits, b[6..9] = pad6. Multi-byte values are little endian. "target" = player record
// 0..7, 0xff = the player who sent the packet. After a debug packet was applied, its b[3..5] are cleared, so
// player_commands_process applies "no steering, no keys" for that tick (the same in the record run, the
// playback and on every peer). Unused bytes are 0.

// ---- god mode -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Where the flag lives: in a mode run g_mode.players[p].flags & MODE_PLAYER_GOD (mode.h); in the campaign bit 0
// of the player block byte P+0x3ae (PlayerBlock.pad3ae[0], between slot_left and slot_right; zero in every one
// of the original's 51924 per-tick reference dumps). It is GameState, so savestates, movie snapshots and
// net_state_checksum (the P block) carry it; players_init_records clears it with the record at the next level
// start). debug_cmd_tick() (once per tick, after the mode tick) keeps a god wizard's
// health and mana full and its invulnerability timer >= 2 (pending damage is discarded, the HUD blinks).
