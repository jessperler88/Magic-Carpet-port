// (GameState snapshot) and movie/mapNNNNN.dat (the maps). Owner: demo.cpp.
//
// Recording format (established from demo_record_playback_step_3c540 and the shipped mvi00000.dat):
// a headerless stream of 10-byte CmdPacket records, one per player per tick in player order
// (player_count of the snapshot = 4 in the shipped movie), written from inside
// player_commands_process_3a8b0 right before each packet is executed. No lengths, no checksums. The
// recording ends with the packet that carried the quit command (cmd 2) of the recording player, so
// the file is ticks * players * 10 + 10 bytes: 342,010 = 8550 * 4 * 10 + 10.
//
// The snapshot pair is written when the first packet is recorded, i.e. in the middle of
// player_commands_process: the tick counters are already incremented, player 0's packet is not yet
// executed. Playback therefore loads the state at the same point (first call for player 0).
