// The level of a mode run (Phase 4, round 10 task A; docs/analysis/port_mode.md). Nothing here exists in
// carpet.exe.
//
// Until round 11's world module and placer, a mode level is one of the 20 multiplayer maps of levels.dat
// (indices 50..69, the lobby's levels) used as a template, 256 x 256:
//   - template: ModeParams.map when it is 50..69, else chosen from the seed among the maps with enough
//     player slots (footer player_count >= humans + bots; every map but 51 has 8) - mode_template_level();
//   - terrain: the template's own generator settings (castle sites, villages and creatures were placed for
//     that terrain); with MODE_PARAM_RESEED the generator seed is replaced by the match seed;
//   - player_count = humans + bots (1..8). Player records 0..humans-1 are the humans (offline: record 0 =
//     the local player), the rest are computer wizards (players_init_records: every non-local record outside
//     a network game);
//   - the mode checksum (mode_checksum) also covers g_ai_rand_seed, g_ai_human_wizard, g_terrain_nearly_flat;
//   - at the level start (g_hook_mode_level_start): the AI's CRT seed g_ai_rand_seed and its cached human
//     wizard g_ai_human_wizard are reset from the match seed, every record's campaign spell_found is cleared,
//     and the human players get their level start spells as in a network game (the campaign gives a human
//     only the spells found earlier in the campaign - none in a mode run).
// The level is loaded under MODE_LEVEL_INDEX (mode.h) through g_hook_level_source (sim.h), so
// game_level_begin, restarts (level_finish) and savestate loads find it like a levels.dat entry.
